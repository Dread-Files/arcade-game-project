===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# Udacity Frogger Game

This is the Udacity project for develeping a game with Javascript. So far, the game is playable, but thats it, there is no score or level system. However, the game is made to be very difficult.

## How to Run the Game

To launch the game, you simply need to double-click 'index.html' in the 'frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game' folder. This will open your default browser to view the game.

## Playing the Game

The controls and objective of the game are very simple. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the character on the grass. Your objective is to reach the water while dodging other bugs.

## Changes

This is the initial release. so far the character and bug image sizes have been changed with GIMP 2.0. I would like to turn this into a proper/complete game that will attract player, but I have a time sensitive schedule and need to complete this nanodegree as soon as possible.
